# Hybrid Resume Analysis using Machine Learning and Generative AI

## Project Overview
This project implements a hybrid AI system that performs resume classification, clustering, deep learning-based modeling, and AI-driven skill analysis.

The dataset consists of 100 manually curated resume samples across five domains:
- Data Science
- Web Development
- Testing
- Cloud Computing
- Cyber Security

## Architecture Overview

The system includes:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering using TF-IDF
3. Supervised Learning (Logistic Regression)
4. Deep Learning (Neural Network Model)
5. Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering)
6. Generative AI-based Resume Analysis
